# Calculations Program

## Description
This project defines and implements basic arithmetic operations using JavaScript functions. It performs **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** on an array of integers.

## Features
- **Defines functions** for arithmetic operations:
  - `findSum(arr)`: Returns the **sum** of all numbers in an array.
  - `subtractNumbers(a, b)`: Subtracts **b from a**.
  - `multiplyNumbers(a, b)`: Multiplies **a and b**.
  - `divideNumbers(a, b)`: Divides **a by b**, handling **division by zero**.
- Uses an array of **three integers** to:
  - Calculate the **sum** using `findSum()`.
  - Perform **subtraction** using the **first two numbers**.
  - Perform **multiplication** using the **third and first numbers**.
  - Perform **division** using the **sum of all numbers** divided by the **third number**.

## Files Included
- `calculations.js` - JavaScript file containing all function definitions and calculations.


## How to Use
1. Run `calculations.js` in a JavaScript environment.
2. Modify the array values to test different numbers.
3. Observe the logged outputs for the different calculations.

## Technologies Used
